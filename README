Nag(ix)SC
=========

Transport of Nagiosâ„¢/Icinga check results over HTTP or any other way *you* like!

Nag(ix)SC is a replacement for NRPE (Nagios Remote Plugin Executor) and NSCA
(Nagios Service Check Acceptor) supporting multiple transport mechanisms like
HTTP(S), SSH, rsync, or whatever you like. It may be used to execute Nagios/
Icinga plugins on a remote host or to send service check results to a central
monitoring server.
 .
Nag(ix)SC includes simple HTTP server implementations to send and receive
check results and execute plugins. HTTP is the preferred way to transfer the
generated data because of the following benefits:

  * simple protocol with many existing support tools (e.g. curl) and libraries
    for basically any programming and scripting language
  * support for relaying/forwarding through (reverse-)proxies
  * support for authorization and authentication
  * support for encryption (HTTPS)
  * filtering possibilities
